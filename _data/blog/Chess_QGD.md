# <u> Introduction </u>

The Queen's Gambit is an essential queen's pawn opening played at every level of chess competition. It's characterized by the moves 1. d4 d5 2. c4 with White seeking to gain a positional advantage by undermining Black's control of the center. Black has many options here! They can decide to respond with 2... dxc4, gaining a pawn advantage immediately in return for giving up control of the center. They can also choose to defend the d5 pawn, declining the gambit.

The Queen's Gambit is not always recommended for beginners playing as White as it involves a significant amount of opening theory and different variations that the player must be aware of. As a beginner to intermediate player, I decided to learn this for my opening repetoire in hope to develop my chess skills.
